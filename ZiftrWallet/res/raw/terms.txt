4. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

As described in more detail below, our Services provides browser software that (a) generates and stores cryptocoin wallet addresses and private keys, and (b) facilitates the submission of cryptocoin transaction requests to the cryptocoin network without requiring you to personally download and install the associated cryptocoin network software.

4.1. Wallet Address and Private Key. When you create an Account, the Services (software in your browser), generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive cryptocoins via the cryptocoin network. An encrypted backup of the wallet is stored by the Service. The public key generated by the Services serves as your cryptocoin wallet address, and may be shared with the cryptocoin network and with others to complete cryptocoin transactions. The private key uniquely matches the wallet address and must be used in connection with the wallet address to authorize the transfer of cryptocoins from or to that wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key. You acknowledge and agree that anybody that has access to your wallet address and private key pair will be able to access, spend or transfer the cryptocoins associated with that wallet address.

4.2. No Password Retrieval. Our Services do not receive or store your Account password nor the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account password retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember or recover your password, including by allowing you to set password hints but the Services cannot generate a new password for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF ANY WALLET ADDRESSES AND PRIVATE KEY PAIRS MAINTAINED IN YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY CRYPTOCOINS YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH WALLET ADDRESSES WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD.

4.3. Transaction Requests. All proposed cryptocoin transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the public ledger via the cryptocoin distributed consensus network (“Verification Network”), which is not owned, controlled or operated by Company. The Services help you submit your cryptocoin transaction request for confirmation to the Verification Network. However, the cryptocoin network, including the Verification Network, is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Company has no control over the cryptocoin network, including the Verification Network, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Verification Network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Verification Network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Verification Network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.

4.4. No Storage or Transmission of cryptocoins.  Cryptocoins are an intangible asset, they exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the cryptocoin network. The Services do not store, send or receive cryptocoins. Any transfer of title in cryptocoins occurs within the decentralized cryptocoin network and not within the Services.

4.5. Relationship. Company is an independent contractor for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee.

4.6. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You acknowledge and agree that Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any cryptocoin transaction initiated via the Services. For instance, if you mistype a wallet address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection with any transaction request to send cryptocoins via the Service, the cryptocoins will be sent to whatever wallet address or information you provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction request details carefully before completing any transaction requests via the Services.

4.7. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the cryptocoin Verification Network via the Services, the Verification Network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. Company has no control over the cryptocoin Verification Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. As a result, all transaction requests initiated via the Services are irreversible.

4.8. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you complete via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your cryptocoin transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any cryptocoin transactions.

5. Fees

5.1. Company Fees. Access to the wallet is free, but the Company may charge fees for additional Services. Any applicable fees will be displayed in each Service.

5.2. Miners Fees.

(a) Overview of cryptocoin Mining. The cryptocoin Verification Network (described above) is operated by a network of computers that have installed the cryptocoin network software. The individuals who operate those computers, called “miners,” voluntarily participate in the Verification Network confirmation process. Cryptocoin miners compile a list of pending cryptocoin transactions, called “blocks,” verify that each transaction in the block is valid and does not involve an attempt to re-spend cryptocoins, and solve a mathematical algorithm to confirm that the block should be added to the public ledger of confirmed blocks, called the “blockchain.” cryptocoin mining is a competitive process. The first miner to verify the transactions in a block and solve the associated algorithms receive (i) an amount of cryptocoins as a reward, which are generated automatically via the cryptocoin network, and (ii) any fees voluntarily included within the block by the individuals who initiated the proposed transactions (“Miners Fees”). Since miners verify cryptocoin transactions on a voluntary basis, it is customary to include a Miners Fee in order to provide an incentive to the miners to add a proposed transaction to the next block for confirmation via the Verification Network.

(b) Miners Fees Options. Our Services facilitate your ability to independently set a Miners Fee by using the “custom send” transaction request, or to use a recommended default fee.  In connection with certain transaction requests, such as “shared coin”, we will provide you with notice of the minimum Miners Fees required by the cryptocoin network to complete those transactions. All other transaction requests permitted via the Services are subject to default Miners Fee settings established via the Services. 

ALL ACCOUNTS START WITH A DEFAULT SETTING. YOU MAY MODIFY
YOUR DEFAULT MINERS FEE SETTINGS BY ACCESSING THE ACCOUNT SETTINGS
FEATURE OF YOUR ACCOUNT. You acknowledge and agree that Company does not
receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the Services, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.

DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES

We may, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any wallet address and private key pair that you maintain in your Account. If you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of the Services, you will be unable to access cryptocoins associated with any wallet address maintained in your Account in the event that we discontinue the Services.
